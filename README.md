# PaperS3 User Demo

User demo source code of [PaperS3](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/PaperS3).

Converted to work with PlatformIO.

## Build

Fetch dependencies with `python fetch_repos.py`.

Then just let PIO do its thing.

Originally built with ESP-IDF 5.3.3, this version is building with 5.5.0 (with updates to underlying libraries).
